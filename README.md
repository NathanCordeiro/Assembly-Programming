## **Compiling and Linking an Assembly Program in NASM**

Make sure you have set the path of nasm and ld binaries in your PATH environment variable. Now, take the following steps for compiling and linking the above program âˆ’
Type the above code using a text editor and save it as hello.asm.
Make sure that you are in the same directory as where you saved hello.asm.

> 1. To assemble the program, type ```nasm -f elf hello.asm```

*If there is any error, you will be prompted about that at this stage. Otherwise, an object file of your program named ```hello.o``` will be created.*

> 2. To link the object file and create an executable file named hello, type ```ld -m elf_i386 -s -o hello hello.o```

> 3. Execute the program by typing ```./hello```

*If you have done everything correctly, it will display 'Hello, world!' on the screen.*
